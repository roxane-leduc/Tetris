# Tetris

Tetris game made with two people in C language as part of a study project.

This project allowed us to take our first steps into the world of object-oriented programming. We were able to apply what we had learned in class and to really understand the way of thinking of this type of programming.

We were also able to learn by ourselves how to use the swing and awt libraries.
